/**
 * The GEDCOM EVent-Base Parser header file.
 * 
 * This file defines the components of an event-based parser for GEDCOM.
 * The idea is to provide for arbitrary file sizes by keeping a minimal
 * amount of data resident in memory, while providing a more processed
 * version of the GEDCOM transmission than the serialization provides.
 * 
 * The following guarantees are maintained:
 * 
 * - There are the same number of `GED_START` and `GED_END~ events.
 * - The first event is a `GED_START` (with `data` `"HEAD"`)
 * - The last event is a `GED_END` (with `data` `"TRLR"`)
 * - `GED_ANCHOR` only occurs immediately following `GED_START`.
 * - Between any given pair of `GED_START` events, there may be either
 *   (a single `GED_POINTER`) or (any number of `GED_TEXT` and 
 *   `GED_LINBREAK`), but not both.
 * 
 * This file and all of its contents was authored by Luther Tychonievich
 * and has been released into the public domain by its author.
